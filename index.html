          Marketing research is the function that links the consumer, customer,
          and public to the marketer through information—information used to
          identify and define marketing opportunities and problems; generate,
          refine, and evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance;
          and improve understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing
          research specifies the information required to address these issues,
          designs the method for collecting information, manages and implements
          the data collection process, analyzes the results, and communicates
          the findings and their implications.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="my-1">
          According to the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), influencer
          marketing focuses on leveraging individuals who have influence over
          potential buyers and orienting marketing activities around these
          individuals to drive a brand message to the larger market. In
          influencer marketing, rather than marketing directly to a large group
          of consumers, a brand inspires or compensates influencers (which can
          include celebrities, content creators, customer advocates, and
          employees) to get the word out on their behalf.

            Green marketing refers to the development and marketing of products
            that are presumed to be environmentally safe (i.e., designed to
            minimize negative effects on the physical environment or to improve
            its quality). This term may also be used to describe efforts to
            produce, promote, package, and reclaim products in a manner that is
            sensitive or responsive to ecological concerns.

          <p class="my-1 p-2">
            Viral marketing is a marketing phenomenon that facilitates and
            encourages people to pass along a marketing message. Nicknamed
            “viral” because the number of people exposed to a message mimics the
            process of passing a virus or disease from one person to another.
